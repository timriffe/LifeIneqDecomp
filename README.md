## Description

This package provides a function to decompose a lifespan inequality index into additive components of between-group inequality and within-group inequality. Presently implemented for Theil's index, e-edagger, variance, mean log deviation, and the Gini coeficient.

For each index, the decomposition is of the form T = W + B, where T is the total lifespan inequality, W is the lifespan inequality within groups, and B is the inequality between groups.
